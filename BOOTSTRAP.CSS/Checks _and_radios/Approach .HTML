  Browser default checkboxes and radios are replaced with the help of .form-check, a series of classes for both input
  types that improves the layout and behavior of their HTML elements, that provide greater customization and cross
  browser consistency. Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting
  one option from many.

  Structurally, our <input>s and <label>s are sibling elements as opposed to an <input> within a <label>. This is
      slightly more verbose as you must specify id and for attributes to relate the <input> and <label>. We use
        the sibling selector (~) for all our <input> states, like :checked or :disabled. When combined with the
        .form-check-label class, we can easily style the text for each item based on the <input>â€™s state.

        <div class="form-check">
          <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="checkDefault">
          <label class="form-check-label" for="checkDefault">
            Default checkbox
          </label>
        </div>
        <div class="form-check">
          <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" value="" id="checkChecked" checked>
          <label class="form-check-label" for="checkChecked">
            Checked checkbox
          </label>
        </div>
